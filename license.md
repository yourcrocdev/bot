This bot is not for commercial use and you must follow Section 2 of the CDE Subscriber Agreement as follows: 

When purchasing a CDE Software, we will provide you with a lifetime license to use it. These licenses are non-transferable and you must not share the software code, files or assets with anyone. Some software is open source (it will be marked as open source and available on CDE's Github) and does not apply to this section. 

 

Open Source Notice: you must not claim the work as yours and you must provide credit as the following:

 

"This product was created by Crocodile Digital Entertainment and edited by me."

 

or

 

"Crocodile Digital created this, but I'm developing it to make it better."

 

CDE will determine whether credit is necessary under certain situations, and whether the correct credit has been given. We may take down certain products that rip-off, or directly copy certain software or services. 

 

Do not attempt to distribute, reverse-engineer, or share any CDE Software unless expressly authorized by CDE or permitted by law. Pirating is against this Agreement and international law.

 

Do not download software you do not trust - CDE is not responsible for damage that is caused from pirated or ripped off software.

 

All CDE Software is owned by CDE and it's licensors, unless clearly expressed. 

 

Open source software (software available to the public, and that can be edited), is still owned by CDE and you must not sell access using subscriptions, supporter donations, or one-time purchases.
